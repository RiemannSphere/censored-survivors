# Coding Guidelines

## 1. Pythonic Practices

- **Elegance and Readability:** Strive for elegant and Pythonic code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- **PEP 8 Compliance:** Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for code style, with Ruff as the primary linter and formatter.
- **Explicit over Implicit:** Favor explicit code that clearly communicates its intent over implicit, overly concise code.
- **Zen of Python:** Keep the Zen of Python in mind when making design decisions.

## 2. Modular Design

- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module/file should have a well-defined, single responsibility.
- **Reusable Components:** Develop reusable functions and classes, favoring composition over inheritance.
- **Package Structure:** Organize code into logical packages and modules.

## 3. Code Quality

- **Comprehensive Type Annotations:** All functions, methods, and class members must have type annotations, using the most specific types possible.
- **Detailed Docstrings:** All functions, methods, and classes must have Google-style docstrings, thoroughly explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised. Include usage examples where helpful.
- **Thorough Unit Testing:** Aim for high test coverage (90% or higher) using `pytest`. Test both common cases and edge cases.
- **Robust Exception Handling:** Use specific exception types, provide informative error messages, and handle exceptions gracefully. Implement custom exception classes when needed. Avoid bare `except` clauses.
- **Logging:** Employ the `logging` module judiciously to log important events, warnings, and errors.

## 4. ML/AI Specific Guidelines

- **Experiment Configuration:** Use `hydra` or `yaml` for clear and reproducible experiment configurations.
- **Data Pipeline Management:** Employ scripts or tools like `dvc` to manage data preprocessing and ensure reproducibility.
- **Experiment Logging:** Maintain comprehensive logs of experiments, including parameters, results, and environmental details.
- **LLM Prompt Engineering:** Dedicate a module or files for managing Prompt templates with version control.
- **Context Handling:** Implement efficient context management for conversations, using suitable data structures like deques.

## 5. Performance Optimization

- **Asynchronous Programming:** Leverage `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations to maximize concurrency.
- **Caching:** Apply `functools.lru_cache`, `@cache` (Python 3.9+) caching where appropriate.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Use `psutil` or similar to monitor resource usage and identify bottlenecks.
- **Memory Efficiency:** Ensure proper release of unused resources to prevent memory leaks.
- **Concurrency:** Employ `concurrent.futures` or `asyncio` to manage concurrent tasks effectively.
- **Database Best Practices:** Design database schemas efficiently, optimize queries, and use indexes wisely.

# Code Example Requirements

- All functions must include type annotations.
- Must provide clear, Google-style docstrings.
- Key logic should be annotated with comments.
- Provide usage examples (e.g., in the `tests/` directory or as a `__main__` section).
- Include error handling.
- Use `ruff` for code formatting.

# Others

- **When explaining code, provide clear logical explanations and code comments.**
- **When making suggestions, explain the rationale and potential trade-offs.**
- **If code examples span multiple files, clearly indicate the file name.**
- **Do not over-engineer solutions. Strive for simplicity and maintainability while still being efficient.**
- **Favor modularity, but avoid over-modularization.**
- **Use the most modern and efficient libraries when appropriate, but justify their use and ensure they don't add unnecessary complexity.**
- **When providing solutions or examples, ensure they are self-contained and executable without requiring extensive modifications.**
- **If a request is unclear or lacks sufficient information, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.**
- **Always consider the security implications of your code, especially when dealing with user inputs and external data.**
- **Actively use and promote best practices for the specific tasks at hand (LLM app development, data cleaning, demo creation, etc.).**

# This Project

## Project Description

- This is a project aimed at learning, exploring, and experimenting with survivor analysis.
- The main motivation is customer churn prediction without exact time-to-event and churn status data. Data is lacking due to legal reasons.
- The key idea is to use various proxies instead of the actual churn data, for example: days since last activity, drops in platform engagement, etc.

## Code Practices

- Every model (ex. Kaplan-Meier) will have its own directory in the /src
- Every model has two key files inside - run.py and generate.py
- run.py is for running the model
- generate.py is for generating simulated data in order to test the model on reliable source

## Example Data

### Kaplan-Meier

Input:
```json
[
  { "customer_id": 1, "time_since_signup": 120, "event_status": 1 },
  { "customer_id": 2, "time_since_signup": 200, "event_status": 0 },
  { "customer_id": 3, "time_since_signup": 90, "event_status": 1 },
  { "customer_id": 4, "time_since_signup": 300, "event_status": 0 }
]
```

Output:
```json
[
  { "time": 90, "survival_probability": 0.90 },

]

```

Output:
```json
[
  { "customer_id": 1, "time_to_churn": 3.5 },

  { "customer_id": 3, "time_to_churn": 1.2 }
]
```

### Customer Behavioral Cohorts

We divide customers based on their behavior.
We assume every customer has one tag from every category.

1. Engagement-Based Cohorts
"Power Users" → Frequent logins, high posting activity, multi-network usage.
"Casual Users" → Moderate logins, occasional posting, stable engagement.
"Passive Users" → Rare logins, low posting frequency, little engagement.
"Ghost Users" → No recent logins or posts, possibly at churn risk.

2. Posting Behavior Cohorts
"Platform Advocates" → 90%+ of posts are via the platform.
"Mixed Posters" → 50% platform posts, 50% native posts.
"Native Posters" → 90%+ posts are published directly on social networks (churn risk).
"No Posters" → Logged in but hasn’t posted in X days.
